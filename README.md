# Group 2

*  Participants: Dmitry Mikhaylov, Lara Schmalenstroer, Rohitha Ravinder

## Development of a working hypothesis to answer a relevant biomedical question and draft an algorithm

## Relevant biomedical question :

## To find chemical compounds that interact with the genes are involved in Parkinson's Disease


## Steps

1. Find a gene expression experiment in GEO
2. Find chemicals that interact with the genes involved in CTD
3. Find complexes chemicals from CTD in ChEMBL


## Databases

1. GEO
2. CTD
3. ChEMBL
